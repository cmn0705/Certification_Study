       "  'explain': \"Network Load Balancer overview -\\r\\nA Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.\\r\\nWhen you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For more information, see Availability Zones.\\r\\nIf you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an Availability Zone, we remove the\\r\\nIP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn't honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the requests fail.\\r\\nFor TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number. The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of the connection.\\r\\nFor UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.\\r\\nAn Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.\\r\\nThe size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.\\r\\nAn Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and launches another instance to replace it.\\r\\nReference:\\r\\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\",\n",

AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume ג€\" there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service ג€\" all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging.

       "  'explain': 'Amazon RDS Read Replicas Now Support Multi-AZ Deployments\\r\\nStarting today, Amazon RDS Read Replicas for MySQL and MariaDB now support Multi-AZ deployments. Combining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and simplify your database engine upgrade process.\\r\\nAmazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS\\r\\nRegion. Updates made to the source database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance when needed.\\r\\nAmazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.\\r\\nYou can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.\\r\\nYou can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance, and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.\\r\\nOverview of Amazon RDS Read Replicas\\r\\nDeploying one or more read replicas for a given source DB instance might make sense in a variety of scenarios, including the following:\\r\\nScaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can direct this excess read traffic to one or more read replicas.\\r\\nServing read traffic while the source DB instance is unavailable. In some cases, your source DB instance might not be able to take I/O requests, for example due to I/O suspension for backups or scheduled maintenance. In these cases, you can direct read traffic to your read replicas. For this use case, keep in mind that the data on the read replica might be \"stale\" because the source DB instance is unavailable.\\r\\nBusiness reporting or data warehousing scenarios where you might want business reporting queries to run against a read replica, rather than your primary, production DB instance.\\r\\nImplementing disaster recovery. You can promote a read replica to a standalone instance as a disaster recovery solution if the source DB instance fails.\\r\\nReference:\\r\\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/01/amazon-rds-read-replicas-now-support-multi-az-deployments/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html',\n",

In this case, 100% — (1% x 1%) = 99.99%. Because the database represents a hard dependency, you multiply the availability of the EC2 instances by the availability of the RDS instance, which is 99 percent. In this case, 99.99% x 99% = 98.99%. A total availability of 99 percent may seem intuitive since it's the availability of each component, but because the redundant EC2 instances have a hard dependency on the RDS instance, you must multiple the availabilities together. A total availability of 99.99 percent is unachievable since it's well above the availability of any of the components. 97 percent would represent the totalapplication availability if the EC2 instances were hard dependencies instead of redundant components.\",\n",
